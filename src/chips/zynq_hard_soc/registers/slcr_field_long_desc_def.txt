** SCL LOCK
Secure configuration lock for these slcr registers:
SCL, PSS_RST_CTRL, APU_CTRL, and
WDT_CLK_SEL.
Read:
0: unlocked, Secure writes to secure configuration
registers are enabled.
1: locked, all writes to secure configuration
registers are ignored.
Write:
0: noaffect.
1: lock the secure configuration registers.
Once the secure registers are locked, they remain
locked until a power-on reset cycle (PS_POR_B)

** SLCR_LOCK LOCK_KEY
Write the lock key, 0x767B, to write protect the
slcr registers: all slcr registers, 0xF800_0000 to
0xF800_0B74, are write protected until the unlock
key is written to the SLCR_UNLOCK register. A
read of this register returns zero.
